- Pedestrians: Include considerations for walking speeds, mobility aids, and direct route preferences. Example: "The system shall identify pedestrians crossing the roadway at speeds between 0.8 to 1.8 m/s, adjusting vehicle stopping distance to maintain a safe buffer zone of at least 3 meters."
- Cyclists: Account for space requirements and operating speeds. Example: "The system shall detect cyclists operating in bike lanes with a minimum width of 1.5 meters and adjust vehicle trajectory to maintain a clearance of 1.5 meters when overtaking."
- Motorists: Address interactions with large vehicles and dynamic road conditions. Example: "The system shall restrict lane changes near commercial vehicles exceeding 10 meters in length in high-density traffic to minimize collision risk."
- Micromobility Users: Include requirements for electric scooters and e-bikes. Example: "The system shall detect micromobility users in shared lanes and adjust vehicle speed to ensure a minimum safe distance of 1 meter."
- Commercial Vehicles: Specify space and maneuvering needs. Example: "The system shall identify commercial delivery vehicles and provide a safe loading/unloading zone by stopping at least 5 meters away from the vehicle."
- Non-Motorized Users: Consider inline skaters, skateboarders, and others. Example: "The system shall detect non-motorized users on shared pathways and adjust its speed to match the user's operating range, between 5 to 15 km/h."

Ambiguity Resolution: Resolve vague terms in the documents by converting them into specific, quantifiable requirements. For example:

- If "adequate space" is mentioned, specify: "The system shall provide at least 1.8 meters of clearance for wheelchairs at crossings."
- If "visibility" is referenced, clarify: "The system shall detect roadway users under low-light conditions at a minimum distance of 50 meters, ensuring timely response."

Contextual Adaptability: Adapt the specifications for different contexts, addressing the unique requirements of roadway users in each setting:

- Urban Settings: Prioritize dense traffic conditions, pedestrian-heavy zones, signalized intersections, and multi-modal roadways. Example: "In urban areas, the system shall identify and yield to pedestrians at crosswalks, adjusting vehicle speed to under 10 km/h when approaching intersections with high pedestrian traffic."
- Suburban Settings: Address mixed-use pathways, moderate traffic, and residential zones. Example: "In suburban contexts, the system shall identify shared bicycle-pedestrian pathways, maintaining a buffer zone of 2 meters around detected cyclists and pedestrians."
- Rural Settings: Focus on unsignalized crossings, limited road infrastructure, and varying road conditions. Example: "In rural areas, the system shall detect slow-moving agricultural equipment and provide a warning signal to following vehicles when approaching at a distance of 100 meters."

Use the pattern: "In [context], the system shall [action] [object] when [condition]."

Example Conversion:

- Input Text: "Micromobility users, such as electric scooters, require smooth surfaces but sometimes share sidewalks not designed for their speeds."
- Output Domain Specification:
  - Urban Context: "The system shall detect electric scooters on sidewalks and adjust vehicle proximity to maintain a distance of at least 1.5 meters, reducing speed to under 15 km/h when passing."
  - Suburban Context: "The system shall identify shared sidewalks and bicycle lanes used by electric scooters, ensuring a smooth deceleration when scooters are detected within a 20-meter range."
  - Rural Context: "In rural settings, the system shall detect micromobility users on road shoulders and adjust its lane position to provide a clearance of 2 meters."

**ChatGPT said:**

The domain specifications provided above address the lack of specificity, ambiguity, and contextual adaptability for various roadway users in interaction with Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). Here’s how they do so:

1. **Specificity:**
   - The specifications convert vague terms like "adequate space" into measurable requirements, such as "maintain a buffer zone of at least 3 meters" or "adjust vehicle speed to under 10 km/h when passing within a 2-meter distance."
   - Specific speed ranges, distances, and conditions are provided for detecting various users (e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists, micromobility users). For example:
     - Pedestrians: "The system shall detect pedestrians crossing the roadway at speeds between 0.8 to 1.8 m/s."
     - Bicyclists: "The system shall detect cyclists operating in bike lanes with a minimum width of 1.5 meters."
   - Detailed requirements for different types of roadway users, such as children, mobility aid users, e-bike riders, and tandem bicyclists, ensure that ADS can adapt to the unique characteristics of each group.

2. **Ambiguity Resolution:**
   - The use of clear actions and conditions in the "The system shall [action] [object] when [condition]" pattern eliminates ambiguity. For example:
     - "The system shall identify wheelchair users at crosswalks and stop at least 2 meters away when within a 5-meter radius."
     - "The system shall detect electric scooters on sidewalks and adjust vehicle proximity to maintain a distance of at least 1.5 meters."
   - By specifying the operational design domain (ODD) contexts (urban, suburban, rural), the requirements are explicitly tied to the environmental conditions in which the ADS must operate, resolving context-related ambiguities.

3. **Contextual Adaptability:**
   - The requirements adapt to different environments, including urban, suburban, and rural settings:
     - Urban Context: "The system shall detect pedestrians crossing the roadway at speeds between 0.8 to 1.8 m/s and adjust vehicle stopping distance to maintain a buffer zone of at least 3 meters when within 10 meters of a crosswalk."
     - Suburban Context: "The system shall identify pedestrians on shared pathways and maintain a 2-meter buffer zone when passing within residential zones."
     - Rural Context: "The system shall detect pedestrians walking on road shoulders and provide a visual warning to the driver when pedestrians are within a 50-meter range."
   - Contextual adaptability is achieved by tailoring the requirements for each roadway user category to match the unique challenges of different environments, such as high-density urban areas, moderate suburban zones, or wide-open rural roads.
   - Each user category's domain specifications include contextual information (e.g., crosswalks, sidewalks, intersections) that ensure the ADS adapts its actions according to the environment.

### Examples of Addressing Specificity, Ambiguity, and Contextual Adaptability:

- **Pedestrians:**
  - **Specificity:** The system addresses specific pedestrian types, including those using mobility aids and children, with detailed conditions for speed and stopping distances.
  - **Ambiguity Resolution:** Uses specific measurements like "buffer zone of at least 3 meters" to remove any ambiguity about the necessary stopping distance.
  - **Contextual Adaptability:** Adapts to urban, suburban, and rural settings, with tailored responses for crosswalks, shared pathways, and road shoulders.

- **Bicyclists:**
  - **Specificity:** Differentiates between types of bicycles (standard, tandem, with trailers) and their unique space requirements.
  - **Ambiguity Resolution:** Clearly defines actions, such as maintaining a 1.5-meter clearance when overtaking.
  - **Contextual Adaptability:** Specifies different behaviors for urban bike lanes, suburban pathways, and rural road shoulders.

- **Micromobility Users (Electric Scooters, E-bikes):**
  - **Specificity:** Specifies speed ranges (e.g., "traveling at speeds between 10 and 25 km/h") and the necessary buffer zones for safe operation.
  - **Ambiguity Resolution:** Clearly outlines when the system should decelerate and how much clearance is required, depending on the context.
  - **Contextual Adaptability:** Provides separate requirements for urban sidewalks, suburban mixed-use lanes, and rural road shoulders.

### Overall Summary:
- The domain specifications use detailed, measurable requirements (e.g., distances, speeds, buffer zones) to provide specificity and clarity.
- Contextual adaptability is incorporated by defining how the system should behave in different environments (urban, suburban, rural) and for various user interactions.
- Ambiguities are resolved by using precise terms and conditions, ensuring that the ADS can operate safely and effectively across diverse road environments.

In conclusion, the provided domain specifications effectively tackle the challenges of specificity, ambiguity, and contextual adaptability, ensuring comprehensive safety and operational requirements for all roadway users in interaction with ADS.

1. Pedestrians:
Domain Specification:
Definition: Pedestrians include individuals walking, running, using mobility aids (e.g., wheelchairs, walkers), pushing strollers, and children, as well as visually or hearing-impaired individuals.
ODD Context: Applies to urban (sidewalks, crosswalks), suburban (shared pathways, residential zones), and rural environments (road shoulders, unsignalized crossings).
Functional Requirements:
Urban Context: "The system shall detect pedestrians crossing the roadway at speeds between 0.8 to 1.8 m/s and adjust vehicle stopping distance to maintain a buffer zone of at least 3 meters when within 10 meters of a crosswalk."

Suburban Context: "The system shall identify pedestrians on shared pathways and maintain a 2-meter buffer zone when passing within residential zones."

Rural Context: "The system shall detect pedestrians walking on road shoulders and provide a visual warning to the driver when pedestrians are within a 50-meter range."

Mobility Aid Users: "The system shall identify wheelchair users crossing the street and stop at least 2 meters away when within a 5-meter radius of crosswalks."

Stroller Users: "The system shall detect individuals pushing strollers and reduce speed to under 10 km/h when passing within a 2-meter distance in residential or high-pedestrian areas."

Children: "The system shall identify small-sized pedestrians and adjust stopping distance to account for unexpected movements within a 5-meter radius, especially near schools and parks."

Non-Functional Requirements:
"The system shall maintain a pedestrian detection accuracy of 95% under low-light and inclement weather conditions at a minimum distance of 50 meters."
"The system shall respond to pedestrian crossing signals within 1 second of activation to ensure timely deceleration."
Contextual Adaptability:
Urban: Frequent crosswalks, high pedestrian density.
Suburban: Shared pathways, moderate pedestrian activity.
Rural: Road shoulders, infrequent crossings.

The specifications for the other categories (Micromobility Users, Individuals with Disabilities, Motorists, etc.) would follow a similar pattern, where each element is structured using schema.org vocabulary and represents specific requirements, contexts, and functional conditions. This approach effectively organizes the information into a machine-readable format for better contextual adaptability in autonomous driving systems.

The knowledge graphs above use the schema.org vocabulary to comprehensively represent each type of roadway user, addressing the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as contextual adaptability in various operational design domains (ODDs). These structured specifications allow for precise data exchange and integration into autonomous driving systems to ensure the safety and adaptability of different road user interactions.

Yes, the knowledge graph specifications are structured accurately using schema.org vocabulary, covering all the relevant details, including definitions, operational design domain (ODD) contexts, functional and non-functional requirements, and contextual adaptability for each category of roadway user. These specifications effectively address challenges of specificity, ambiguity, and contextual adaptability, making them suitable for integration into autonomous driving systems (ADS).

If there are additional modifications, refinements, or validations you would like to perform, let me know, and I can assist with those as well.
